A simple website crawler with `$` selector-type syntax.

## Introduction

Provides an instance of a `queue` that will iterate concurrently until all items have been processed. Each iteration calls the provided handler with a [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/) like `$` selector syntax for ease of accessing any relevant DOM nodes. A helper method `trimText` is also provided for a common task of selecting and trimming a node's text value. Crawling a website will continue for as long as items are queued.

## Installation

`npm i --save CentralPing/crawler`

### Requests
One or more requests can be pushed onto the queue at a time. Each request must be an object with a `req` property that contains a valid [options object or URL](https://github.com/request/request#requestoptions-callback) for a [request](https://github.com/request/request). Any global optons will be replaced by any matching request options (e.g. `maxRedirects`). The request object will also be passed back to the callback handler as the 4th argument.

```js
// Single requests
queue.push({req: 'http://www.github.com'}, callback);
queue.push({req: {url: 'http://www.cnn.com', maxRedirects: 10}}, callback);

// Multiple requests
queue.push([
  {req: 'http://www.github.com'},
  {req: {url: 'http://www.cnn.com', maxRedirects: 10}}
], callback);
```

### Callback
The callback is executed once per every request. Four arguments are passed to the callback: `(error, response, $body, request)`.
* **error**: An error object from the request.
* **response**: The raw response object from the request.
* **$body**: The DOM of the response HTML.
* **request**: The original queued request object.
